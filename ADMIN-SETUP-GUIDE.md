# 🔧 Admin Portal Setup Guide

Welcome to the **Effortless Desk Admin Portal** setup guide! This guide will walk you through creating a GitHub Personal Access Token and configuring your admin portal for cross-device file management.

---

## 📋 What You'll Need

- ✅ A GitHub account (you already have one: `Abdulrahmanx007`)
- ✅ Access to your repository: `Abdulrahmanx007/Eand`
- ✅ 5 minutes of your time
- ✅ A secure password for your admin portal

---

## 🔐 Step 1: Create GitHub Personal Access Token

### Why do we need this?
A Personal Access Token (PAT) allows the admin portal to securely upload, download, and manage files in your GitHub repository. Think of it as a special password just for the admin portal.

### How to create it:

1. **Go to GitHub Settings**
   - Open GitHub and click your profile picture (top right)
   - Click **Settings**

2. **Navigate to Developer Settings**
   - Scroll down the left sidebar
   - Click **Developer settings** (at the very bottom)

3. **Access Personal Access Tokens**
   - Click **Personal access tokens**
   - Click **Tokens (classic)**

4. **Generate New Token**
   - Click **Generate new token (classic)**
   - GitHub may ask for your password - enter it

5. **Configure Token Settings**
   - **Note/Name**: `Effortless Desk Admin Portal`
   - **Expiration**: Select **No expiration** (or choose a duration)
   - **Scopes**: Check these boxes:
     - ✅ **repo** (Full control of private repositories)
       - This will automatically check all sub-items
   - Scroll down and click **Generate token**

6. **Copy Your Token**
   - ⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Copy the token NOW!
   - It looks like: `ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
   - You won't be able to see it again
   - Store it somewhere safe temporarily

## 🚀 Step 2: Configure Admin Portal

### First Time Setup:

1. **Open Admin Portal**
   - Go to: `https://basher-tech.me/admin.html`
   - Or: `https://abdulrahmanx007.github.io/Eand/admin.html`

2. **Create Your Password**
   - Enter a strong password (you'll use this every time you login)
   - Remember it! There's no password recovery (security feature)

3. **Click Login**
   - A setup wizard will appear (only on first use)

4. **Paste GitHub Token**
   - When prompted, paste your Personal Access Token
   - The one you copied in Step 1

5. **Complete Setup**
   - Click OK
   - Your admin portal is now ready! 🎉
